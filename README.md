## 🛠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

### "I'm slower than before!"
- **Reality**: This is 100% normal and temporary (weeks 1-2)
- **Solution**: Focus on accuracy, not speed - muscle memory takes time
- **Tip**: Your brain is rewiring; speed will explode around week 3

### "Too many commands to remember!"
- **Reality**: You only need 20% of commands for 80% of editing
- **Solution**: Master 2-3 commands daily, ignore the rest initially
- **Tip**: Print a cheatsheet and keep it visible while practicing

### "I keep hitting the wrong keys!"
- **Reality**: Your fingers have years of bad habits to unlearn
- **Solution**: Slow down and be deliberate with each keystroke
- **Tip**: Say commands out loud as you type them

### "I miss my IDE features!"
- **Reality**: Neovim can do everything your IDE does (and more)
- **Solution**: First master motions, then gradually add plugins
- **Tip**: Each week of practice saves months of future development time

### "I want to give up!"
- **Reality**: The learning curve is steep but short
- **Solution**: Commit to just 15 minutes on tough days
- **Tip**: Week 3 is when everything clicks - push through!
