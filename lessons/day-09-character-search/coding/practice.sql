-- Day 09: SQL with Punctuation Targets - Practice f/F/t/T Character Search
-- This file contains SQL with various punctuation marks for practicing character search
-- Goal: Use f, F, t, T to quickly navigate to specific characters like (, ), [, ], {, }, ', ", ;, :, =
-- PostgreSQL Dialect with rich punctuation for navigation practice

-- Practice navigating to parentheses, quotes, and brackets
