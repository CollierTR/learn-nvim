                    <h3>Long Lines to Format</h3>
                    <p class="long-line">This is an extremely long line of text that exceeds normal reading width and should be formatted using the gq command to break it into multiple lines with appropriate line breaks that make the text more readable and easier to follow when displayed in a terminal or text editor with limited width.</p>

                    <p class="long-line">Another very long line that demonstrates the need for text formatting in Vim, especially when working with prose or documentation that has been written without consideration for line length limits, making it difficult to read and edit effectively without proper formatting tools like gq which can automatically wrap text at word boundaries.</p>

                    <p class="long-line">Yet another example of a line that is far too long for comfortable reading and editing, containing multiple concepts and ideas that would benefit from being broken into smaller, more manageable chunks through the use of Vim's powerful text formatting capabilities, which include not only basic line breaking but also intelligent handling of indentation and spacing.</p>

/* This is a multi-line comment that has become too long and unwieldy, making it difficult for developers to read and understand the important information contained within, which is why it should be reformatted using appropriate line breaks */</code></pre>

                    <p class="doc-text">API documentation describing endpoint behavior, expected request formats, response structures, error handling, authentication requirements, rate limiting, and other important details that developers need to understand when integrating with the service.</p>
