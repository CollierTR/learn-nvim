## Pattern Synthesis: Combining Techniques

### Pattern 1: The Register-Macro-Dot Trinity

```vim
" Combine registers, macros, and dot for ultimate power

" Setup: Complex refactoring task
" 1. Store patterns in registers
let @s = 'oldPattern'
let @r = 'newPattern'

" 2. Record macro using registers
qa                          " Start recording
/\<<C-r>s\><CR>            " Search using register s
ciw<C-r>r<Esc>             " Replace with register r
q                          " End recording

" 3. Apply with dot-compatible mapping
nnoremap <leader>r @a
<leader>r                   " Execute macro
n.                         " Find next and repeat

" This combines:
" - Registers for dynamic content
" - Macros for complex operations
" - Dot for easy repetition
```

### Pattern 2: Visual Block + Substitution + Registers

```vim
" Multi-column data transformation

" Original data:
" john:doe:30:engineer
" jane:smith:25:designer
" bob:jones:35:manager

" Step 1: Extract columns to registers
<C-v>                       " Visual block
2j                         " Select first column
t:                         " To before colon
"ay                        " Yank to register a

" Step 2: Transform with substitution
:%s/\(.*\):\(.*\):\(.*\):\(.*\)/let @b = '\2'/

" Step 3: Reconstruct with registers
:put ='Name: ' . @a . ' ' . @b
```

### Pattern 3: Global + Black Hole + Folding

```vim
" Clean code review workflow

" 1. Fold all functions
:set foldmethod=syntax
zM                          " Close all folds

" 2. Open and review specific patterns
:g/TODO/normal! zv         " View all TODOs

" 3. Clean up without register pollution
:g/console\.log/normal! "_dd  " Delete debug statements

" 4. Mark reviewed sections
:g/^function/normal! zomaTODO: Reviewed<Esc>
```

## Master Workflows: Real-World Applications

### Workflow 1: Intelligent Code Migration

```vim
" Migrate old API to new API across project

" Phase 1: Collection
:args **/*.js               " All JS files
:argdo g/oldAPI\./y A      " Collect all old API calls

" Phase 2: Analysis
:new | put a                " New buffer with collected
:sort u                     " Unique occurrences
:%s/^/- [ ] /              " Create checklist

" Phase 3: Systematic replacement
qa                          " Record migration macro
/oldAPI\.method<CR>        " Find old pattern
ciwnewAPI.newMethod<Esc>   " Replace
/oldAPI\.prop<CR>          " Next pattern
ciwnewAPI.attribute<Esc>   " Replace
q                          " End macro

" Phase 4: Apply across files
:argdo normal! @a          " Run macro on all files
:argdo update              " Save all changes
```

### Workflow 2: Documentation Generation

```vim
" Generate docs from code structure

" Step 1: Fold to see structure
:set foldmethod=indent
:set foldlevel=1           " See top-level only

" Step 2: Extract signatures to registers
:g/^function/normal! "Ayy  " Collect all functions
:g/^class/normal! "Byy     " Collect all classes

" Step 3: Generate documentation
:new docs.md
:put ='# API Documentation'
:put =''
:put ='## Functions'
:put a                      " Put function list
:%s/function \(\w\+\).*/### \1/  " Format as headers

:put =''
:put ='## Classes'
:put b                      " Put class list
:%s/class \(\w\+\).*/### \1/     " Format as headers
```

### Workflow 3: Performance Optimization

```vim
" Optimize code using advanced patterns

" 1. Find inefficient patterns with global
:g/for.*length/p           " Find length in loop condition

" 2. Use visual block for parallel optimization
/for (let<CR>              " Find for loops
<C-v>/)<CR>                " Select loop header
:s/\%V\.length/);<CR>const len = array.length; for(i < len/

" 3. Apply dot formula for consistent changes
/\.forEach<CR>             " Find forEach
ciw.map<Esc>              " Change to map
n.n.n.                    " Repeat for all

" 4. Clean up with black hole
:g/^\s*\/\//normal! "_dd  " Remove comments cleanly
```

## Advanced Pattern Combinations

### Combination 1: Register Orchestra

```vim
" Use all register types strategically

" Named registers for project content
"a: API endpoints
"b: Boilerplate code
"c: Configuration

" Special registers for workflow
"+: System clipboard integration
"_: Black hole for clean deletions
"0: Preserved yank
"/: Last search pattern

" Example: Complex replacement preserving clipboard
"+yiw                      " Copy to system clipboard
viw"_d"+P                  " Replace without affecting registers
```

### Combination 2: Fold-Navigate-Edit

```vim
" Use folding for navigation and targeted editing

function! EditFoldedSections()
    " Save position
    mark Z

    " Process each folded section
    normal! gg
    while line('.') < line('$')
        " If on a fold
        if foldclosed('.') != -1
            " Open, edit, close
            normal! zo
            " Perform edit
            normal! A // Reviewed
            normal! zc
        endif
        " Next fold
        normal! zj
    endwhile

    " Return
    normal! 'Z
endfunction
```

### Combination 3: Completion with Intelligence

```vim
" Smart completion based on context

function! SmartComplete()
    let line = getline('.')
    let col = col('.') - 1

    " In comment? Dictionary completion
    if line =~ '^\s*[/#*]'
        return "\<C-x>\<C-k>"

    " After dot? Omni completion
    elseif line[col-1] == '.'
        return "\<C-x>\<C-o>"

    " After path separator? File completion
    elseif line[col-1] =~ '[/\\]'
        return "\<C-x>\<C-f>"

    " In quotes? Line completion
    elseif line[col-1] =~ '[''"`]'
        return "\<C-x>\<C-l>"

    " Default: Keyword completion
    else
        return "\<C-n>"
    endif
endfunction

inoremap <expr> <Tab> SmartComplete()
```

## Efficiency Metrics: Choosing the Right Tool

### Decision Matrix

```vim
" When to use what:

" Single occurrence → Direct edit
ciwNewWord<Esc>

" 2-5 occurrences → Dot formula
ciwNewWord<Esc>n.n.n.

" 5-20 occurrences → Macro
qaciwNewWord<Esc>nq@a@@@@

" 20+ occurrences → Substitution
:%s/\<OldWord\>/NewWord/g

" Pattern-based → Global command
:g/pattern/normal! operation

" Column data → Visual block
<C-v>operation

" Complex pattern → Combination
" (registers + macro + dot)
```

## Practice Challenges

### Challenge 1: Full Refactor

```javascript
// Refactor this legacy code:
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
function calculate() {
    console.log("calculating");
    var result = x + y;
    console.log("result: " + result);
    return result;
}
var z = calculate();
console.log(z);

// Requirements:
// 1. Convert var to const/let
// 2. Remove console.logs
// 3. Convert to arrow function
// 4. Add proper formatting
// Use combination of techniques
```

### Challenge 2: Data Processing

```csv
// Process this CSV data:
ID,NAME,AGE,ROLE,SALARY
001,john doe,30,developer,50000
002,jane smith,25,designer,45000
003,bob jones,35,manager,60000

// Tasks:
// 1. Capitalize names properly
// 2. Add currency symbol to salaries
// 3. Convert to JSON format
// 4. Sort by salary
// Combine visual blocks, registers, and substitution
```

### Challenge 3: Code Generation

```vim
" Generate getters/setters for these fields:
private String firstName;
private String lastName;
private int age;
private boolean active;

" Expected output:
" Getter and setter for each field
" Using macros, registers, and dot formula
```

## Personal Toolkit Creation

### Build Your Arsenal

```vim
" Essential mappings combining techniques
nnoremap <leader>r viw"_dP     " Replace without register pollution
nnoremap <leader>y "+y          " Yank to system clipboard
nnoremap <leader>d "_d          " Delete to black hole
nnoremap <leader>c za           " Toggle fold

" Power functions
function! RefactorWord()
    let word = expand('<cword>')
    let new = input('Replace ' . word . ' with: ')
    execute '%s/\<' . word . '\>/' . new . '/g'
endfunction

" Workflow commands
command! CleanCode :g/console\.\|debugger/d_ | g/^\s*$/d | %s/\s\+$//
command! ExtractFunctions :g/^function/t$ | $put ='' | $put ='// Extracted Functions'
```
