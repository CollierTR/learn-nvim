                <h2>Welcome to Jump History Practice</h2>
                <p>This multi-section website is designed to help you practice jump history navigation. Use Ctrl+o to go back in your jump history and Ctrl+i to go forward. Each section represents a different "page" that creates jump list entries.</p>

                <p>Start by jumping to different sections using the navigation links or search commands. Then practice using the jump history to retrace your steps. The jump list keeps track of significant cursor movements, not just every cursor position.</p>

                <div class="jump-introduction">
                    <h3>Understanding Jump History</h3>
                    <p>Vim maintains a jump list that tracks significant cursor movements. Jumps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moving to a different line with G, gg, or line numbers</li>
                        <li>Search operations with / or ?</li>
                        <li>Using % to match brackets</li>
                        <li>Jumping to marks with ' or `</li>
                        <li>Using tags or other navigation commands</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Practice jumping to different sections and then using Ctrl+o and Ctrl+i to navigate through your history. Try jumping to <a href="#services">Services</a>, then <a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a>, then use Ctrl+o twice to come back here.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="about" class="page-section">
                <h2>About Jump Navigation</h2>
                <p>Jump navigation is one of Vim's most powerful features for maintaining context while exploring code or documents. When you make a significant movement, Vim automatically adds your previous position to the jump list.</p>

                <div class="jump-mechanics">
                    <h3>How Jump Lists Work</h3>
                    <p>The jump list is a stack-like structure, but it's more sophisticated than a simple stack. Vim maintains separate jump lists for each window, and the lists can hold up to 100 entries by default.</p>

                    <p>When you make a jump, your current position is added to the list before moving. This means you can always return to where you came from, even after multiple jumps.</p>

                    <div class="jump-commands">
                        <h4>Essential Jump Commands</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>Ctrl+o</code> - Go to previous jump location</li>
                            <li><code>Ctrl+i</code> - Go to next jump location (forward in history)</li>
                            <li><code>:jumps</code> - Display the jump list</li>
                            <li><code>''</code> - Jump to last jump position</li>
                            <li><code>'.</code> - Jump to last change position</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Try jumping to <a href="#team">Team</a> section now, then return here using jump navigation. Notice how each significant movement creates a new entry in your jump history.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="services" class="page-section">
                <h2>Our Services</h2>
                <p>This services section demonstrates how jump history works with content exploration. When you jumped here from another section, Vim added your previous location to the jump list.</p>

                        <p>Try searching for specific terms using / or ? to create search-based jumps. Search for "frameworks" or "technologies" and notice how search operations add to your jump list.</p>

                        <p>Try jumping to the end of this section with G, then back to the beginning with gg. Each of these movements creates jump entries you can navigate with Ctrl+o and Ctrl+i.</p>
